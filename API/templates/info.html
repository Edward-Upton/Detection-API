        <p style="color: white">The overall system uses Deep Learning Object Detection with TensorFlows Machine Learning library.</p>

        <h4 style="color: white; text-decoration: underline">Training</h4>
        <p style="color: white">The first step was to train a model to be able to detect different LEGO bricks.
        I first tried manually taking photos, labelling them and then training the model with them. This was fine for the initial
        test but it was soon clear that it wouldn't be a viable solution to the training. I looked into how I could automatically
        generate images of LEGO parts and label them. I have used LEGO Digital Designers before and BrickLink had recently launched
        their own one called "Stud.io". I installed it and rendered a couple of parts on the software. After some digging, I noticed
        that for a brief period of time a .povray file was being created in one of the softwares directories. Turns out that this
        software uses an open source, ray-tracing rendering program called POV-RAY and open source 3D designs for this software of
        most LEGO part designs. This led me to develop my own .povray code to render bricks. Using Python, I am able to create unlimited
        amount of random coloured, positioned, lighting options and background patterns that I want to train with.</h5>
        <img src="/static/files/TrainingImagesCollage.png" style="max-width: 100%">
        <p style="color: white">The next step is to train an object detection model with these images but training requires all images 
        to be labelled with the coordinates in that image where the part is and what the ID of that part is. It was easy as getting POV-RAY
        to output the equivalent positions of the brick on the image and find the max and min of those points. So back to training. 
        TensorFlow and other third parties have pretrained models that have been trained on huge databases of general images and allows
        developers to train to their specific needs on the last layer of the model. This cuts down training time greatly as the models already
        have basic knowledge of edges, shapes and colours. I use CUDA drivers and TensorFlow-GPU to run the training on my graphics card to 
        make it run faster. It takes about 30 hours to train to where the error gets to it's lowest value and then the model can only be imporved
        by feeding it more examples.</p>
        <h4 style="color: white; text-decoration: underline">Detection</h4>
        <p style="color: white">To actually use the model that I have trained, I must develop an API that can act as a web server, 
        to take incoming requests, put them into the model and return the outcome. I use Python and Flask to create this webserver. The user
        is able to select or take a picture to be scanned, which is then uploaded to the API, put through the model and then sends back the
        brick or bricks that it has detected with the ID, name, link to get more details online and a preview picture to confirm it.</p>
